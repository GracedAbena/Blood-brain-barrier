# Prediction of Drug Permeability to the Blood-Brain Barrier using Deep Learning
This is a code to the paper - [Prediction of Drug Permeability to the Blood-Brain Barrier using Deep Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355087935_Prediction_of_Drug_Permeability_to_the_Blood-Brain_Barrier_using_Deep_Learning) accepted and published in the Proceedings of 2021 5th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Applications (ICBEA 2021).

In this work, we focused on predicting the permeability of CNS drugs to the blood brain barrier using deep learning. We developed two models to accomplish our goal - a convolutional neural network and a Fully-connected neural network. Relying on only the SMILES
representation of the molecular compounds, our models were able to achieve a competitive advantage over state-of the art models in
classification tasks involving BBBP.
